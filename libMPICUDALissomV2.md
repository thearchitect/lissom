# Introduction #

libMPICUDALissomV2 is a very powerful interface to liblissom\_cuda to allow computation of LISSOM maps on multiGPU systems and on clusters of GPU enabled computers [also these 2 combined, of course ](.md)

NOTE: at the moment is unavailable, as I'm finishing coding it.
This library is also thought of being capable, once ready (it won't take much more), of simulating most of human primary visual cortex [V1 ](.md) on suitable hardware (currently a 16 GPUs cluster by nVidia, the `cudacluster` ).


# Acknowledgments #

I really want to thank nVidia here, for helping me gather access to the computational power and the special hardware I needed, giving me an account on [[`cudacluster`](http://cudacluster.nvidia.com)]

I also thank University of North Carolina, for providing me access to their BASS GPU Cluster.
