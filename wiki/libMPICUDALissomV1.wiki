libMPICUDALissomV1 is the first part of a project to port the liblissom_cuda GPU library to multiGPU systems and to MPI clusters featuring GPU hardware.
V1 supports multiGPU processing.



PLEASE NOTE that the library was modified after some time, corrupting it's function [that is, it doesn't work anymore :P ]
Check V2 for the working version; V1 is there only for `historical` reasons.

Also remember to copy a fresh liblissom.a and lissom.h file within the directory, to make sure it will work (no problem for compiling under Linux, but better doing it).
